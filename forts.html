These serve as great reminders of the bygone eras, mystical kingdoms & their rulers. Most of the forts were built to act as a defence mechanism during wars in order to keep the enemies away.<br><br>These monuments still serve testimony to the test of time they have undergone and have yet maintained their beauty throughout these years. Today these forts are serene, with artfully crumbling yet proudly standing facades and spectacular views.
